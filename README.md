## Background 
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that you’re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## What You're Creating
For this Challenge assignment, you’ll need to create and submit the following deliverable:

A Jupyter notebook that contains your analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
Remember to upload your Jupyter notebook for this assignment to your GitHub repository. Make sure to update the README.md file to explain your project and any information that’s needed to interact with your plots.

## Technologies
I used Jupyter notebook to complete this assingment as it provides excellent data visualization.
